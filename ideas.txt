GridWorld 2.0:
--------------
environment: grid world with agent, goal, walls.
agent:
	- 1D raycast "vision"
		- distance-based; is this basically lidar?
		- 16 rays
	- random start loc
goal:
	- random start loc
	- make it mobile later? (but slower than agent)
reward:
	- +1 for reaching goal
	- -0.01 for step
	- +0.05 for nearing goal (getting closer within vision)




random other ideas:
- agent gets to choose its zoom level / level of detail; size vs detail tradeoff (discrete levels)
-
